### Step 2: Go to the Palmr Repository

Once you're logged in, go to the Palmr repository by clicking on this link: **[https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr](https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr)**.

Alternatively, you can search for "Palmr" in the GitHub search bar and click on the repository owned by **kyantech**.

### Step 3: Fork the Repository

To contribute to the project, youâ€™ll need to create your own copy of the repository. This is called a **fork**. Hereâ€™s how to do it:
1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page.
2. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Step 4: Clone Your Forked Repository

Next, youâ€™ll need to clone your forked repository to your local machine. Hereâ€™s how:
1. On your forked repository page, click the **Code** button.
2. Copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH).
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```

### Step 5: Set Up the `next` Branch as the Base

Before making changes, ensure your local repository is set up to track the `next` branch from the original Palmr repository. Hereâ€™s how:
1. Add the original Palmr repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr.git
   ```
2. Fetch the latest changes from the `next` branch:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream next
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your contribution based on `upstream/next`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name upstream/next
   ```

### Step 6: Make Your Changes

Now youâ€™re ready to make your contributions! This could include:
- Fixing a bug

- Improving documentation
- Writing tests

Make your changes in your local repository using your preferred code editor.

### Step 7: Commit Your Changes Using Conventional Commits

Once youâ€™ve made your changes, commit them to your branch using **Conventional Commits**. Conventional Commits help maintain a clean and consistent commit history. Hereâ€™s how to format your commit messages:

`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

#### Examples:
- `feat: add user authentication`

- `docs: update README file`
- `chore: update dependencies`

#### Steps to Commit:
1. Stage your changes:

  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
2. Commit your changes with a properly formatted message:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat: add new feature for user profiles"
  ```

### Step 8: Push Your Changes to GitHub

After committing your changes, push them to your forked repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

---

### Step 9: Open a Pull Request to the `next` Branch

Now that your changes are on GitHub, you can open a **Pull Request (PR)** to propose your changes to the `next` branch of the Palmr repository. Hereâ€™s how:
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Pull Request** button.
3. On the PR creation page:
   - Set the **base repository** to `kyantech/Palmr`.
   - Set the **base branch** to `next`.
   - Set the **head repository** to your forked repository.
   - Set the **compare branch** to your branch (`your-branch-name`).
4. Fill out the PR form with a clear title and description of your changes.
5. Click **Create Pull Request**.

### Step 10: Wait for Review

Once your PR is submitted, the maintainers will review your changes. They may provide feedback or request additional changes. Be sure to respond to their comments and make any necessary updates.
