title: Manual Installation
---
Manual installation is a bit more complex and labor-intensive compared to installation via Docker Compose. However, by following this step-by-step guide, you can execute the project cleanly.

It's worth noting that even though our frontend and backend are run manually, we will still need to use Docker or another third-party service to run Postgres and MinIO. In this tutorial, we will use Docker with Docker Compose to set up MinIO and Postgres.

For this, within our `apps/server` directory, we already have a Docker Compose file that runs MinIO and Postgres, which are necessary for the application to function. However, feel free to use another service if you prefer. Once again, we are using Docker Compose to reduce the manual effort required to set up these services, especially third-party services like Postgres and MinIO.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step guide.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, we need to have the following tools installed in our environment:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js
- pnpm
- Git

It's important to emphasize that the entire repository was written using the `pnpm` package manager. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use `pnpm` to run the services to avoid potential issues. However, if you prefer to use another package manager like `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun`, you may do so at your own risk. The system might work normally, but it could also present unknown and unmapped errors when using other package managers. So, we strongly recommend using `pnpm`.

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the official repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr.git
```
In the root of this repository, you will find a folder called apps. Inside this folder, there are three subfolders: docs, server, and web. For now, we are interested in the server and web folders, which contain our backend (written in Fastify) and frontend (written in React + Vite), respectively.

### Step 2: Set Up Backend Services
Navigate to the backend folder, where the Docker Compose file for MinIO and Postgres is located:

```bash
cd ./apps/server
```
Inside this folder, you can start by running:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This command will run Postgres and MinIO in the background. If you need to make any changes, the file being executed with docker compose up is located at `apps/server/docker-compose.yaml`. However, we recommend using the default settings for the first run and making changes only after you have a functional version of the base code.

### Step 3: Set Up Backend

With MinIO and Postgres running via Docker Compose, let's proceed to the next steps, which involve running the project itself. Here, we will build and run the project in production mode, not development mode. To do this, we need to build both the backend and frontend applications.

Since we are already in the server folder, let's start with the backend.

#### 3.1: Set Up Environment Variables

We need some environment variables for Palmr to run successfully. For this, we will use the `.env.example` file provided in the repository as a base.

Simply run:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This command copies the necessary environment variables to a `.env` file in the root directory.

#### 3.2: Install Dependencies
Next, we need to initialize the database connected directly to Postgres via Prisma, our ORM. But for Prisma to work, we need to install the dependencies for our backend project. With Node and pnpm installed, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```
#### 3.3: Generate Prisma Client
After the installation is complete, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma generate
```
The prisma generate command generates the Prisma client for the project. This client allows programmatic access to the database.

#### 3.4: Deploy Prisma Migrations
Once the generation is complete, run:

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma migrate deploy
```
The prisma migrate deploy command deploys the Prisma migration.

#### 3.5: Seed the Database
After the migration is deployed, we can seed the database to populate the initial tables with the following command:

```bash
pnpm db:seed
```
Now, our database is ready for the project to run.

#### 3.6: Build and Run the Backend
To run the backend, simply execute:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
This command builds the application for production. After the build is complete, run:

```bash
pnpm start
```
Following these steps, the backend will be functional. To test it, you can access:

```bash
http://localhost:3333/docs
```
This is the API documentation page.

### Step 4: Set Up Frontend
The frontend setup is similar to the backend, but we don't need to run any Docker containersâ€”only the service itself.

#### 4.1: Navigate to the Frontend Directory
If you are in the server folder:

```bash
cd ../web
```
If you are in the root of the repository:

```bash
cd apps/web
```

#### 4.2: Set Up Environment Variables
Once in the web directory, first run:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
This populates the environment variables, just like in the backend.

#### 4.3: Install Dependencies
Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 4.4: Build and Run the Frontend
Now, the process for the frontend is simpler. We can simply run the build with:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
Once the build is complete, start the service with:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Wait for the service to start, and then you can test the entire application at:

```bash
http://localhost:4173
```

That's it! This is the step-by-step guide to manually running a production version of Palmr.
