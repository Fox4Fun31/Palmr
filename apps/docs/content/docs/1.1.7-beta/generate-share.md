title: Creating a share
---

To create a share in Palmr, the process is very intuitive and self-explanatory. There are multiple ways to create a share, but the most straightforward method is through the **Home Page**, specifically in the **Recent Shares** section.

## Home Page

On the home page, there is a **"Recent Shares"** section. When no shares have been created yet, this section will appear as follows:

![Recent Shares Section](/assets/v1/main/shares/share-section.png)

Since no shares exist yet, you will see a **"Create Share"** button prominently displayed.

> **Note:** You don’t need to upload files to create a share! Yes, it’s entirely possible to create a share without adding any files. While this might not make sense in every scenario, some users and use cases find this feature highly valuable.

As mentioned above, shares in Palmr are created first with their settings, and then files can be added later. You can also edit a share at any time.

To create a share, simply click the **"Create Share"** button in the center of the **Recent Shares** section. Doing so will open the following **Create Share** modal:

![Create Share Modal](/assets/v1/main/shares/create-share-modal.png)

Fill in the required information in the modal. The fields **Expiration Date**, **Max Views**, and **Password** are optional but significantly impact how the share functions for recipients:
- **Password:** If set, the recipient must enter the correct password to access the share.
- **Max Views:** If the limit is reached, the share will no longer be accessible unless the creator increases or removes the limit.
- **Expiration Date:** After the expiration date, the share will automatically be disabled unless extended by the creator.

Even the **name** field is optional, but we recommend setting a name for better organization.

Once a share is created, the **Recent Shares** section updates to display a table with the following fields:

- **Name**
- **Created At**
- **Expires At**
- **Status**
- **Security**
- **Files**
- **Recipients**
- **Actions**

To create additional shares, a **"New Share"** button appears in the upper right corner of the **Recent Shares** section.

Clicking this button will reopen the **Create Share** modal.

The **Recent Shares** section displays only the **last 5 shares**. To view all created shares, click the **"View All"** button.

Clicking this redirects you to the **Shares Management** page.

Another way to access the **Shares Management** page is by clicking the **"My Shares"** card on the home page.

## Shares Management Page

The **Shares Management** page is similar to the **Uploads Management** page, but here, you can **add, remove, edit, and view all created shares** without the limitation of only displaying the last 5 shares.

##### Each share has an **Actions** column with the following options:

Clicking the **Edit** button allows you to modify the share details.

## Manage Files

Clicking the **Manage Files** button lets you add or remove files from the share.

## Manage Recipients

Clicking the **Manage Recipients** button lets you add or remove recipients for the share.

> **Note:** Email notifications will only be sent if SMTP settings are properly configured in the system.

## Generate Share Link

Clicking the **Generate Link** button creates a shareable link, which can be customized.

Once generated, you can view and copy the link.

The generated link can be edited or copied from a dropdown menu.

When the generated link is accessed, the recipient can **view and download** the shared files.
