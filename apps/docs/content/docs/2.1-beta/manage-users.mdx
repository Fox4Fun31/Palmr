### User Management Dashboard

Upon selecting **User Management**, the system will automatically direct you to the comprehensive **User Management Dashboard**, your central control panel for all user-related operations.

- During your initial access to the system, you'll notice that the user list contains only the **default Admin** user account, which serves as the primary administrative account.
- Should you find it necessary to modify the Admin user's information or credentials, please note that these changes must be implemented through the dedicated **Profile Management** section, which provides specialized tools for administrator profile maintenance.
- For security purposes and to maintain system integrity, it's important to understand that the currently logged-in Admin user's details cannot be altered directly from within the **User Management Dashboard**.

## Troubleshooting

In the event of any challenges or issues during the user management process, please refer to the following troubleshooting guidelines:

### User Creation Fails

- Carefully verify that all required fields (including name, email address, and role assignments) have been completed with accurate information.
- Perform a thorough check to ensure the email address isn't already associated with an existing account in the system.
- Confirm that your system maintains a stable and active connection to the backend services necessary for user management.

### User Cannot Log In

- First, verify that the user's account status is set to **Active** in the system.
- Double-check that the user is attempting to authenticate with their correct email address and current password combination.
- If authentication issues persist, initiate a password reset procedure to establish new credentials.
