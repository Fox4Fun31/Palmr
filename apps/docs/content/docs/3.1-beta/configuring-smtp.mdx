For Palmr to function with all its best features, you need to configure an email server. To make this process easier, there's a built-in configuration panel inside **Settings** in Palmr. However, only users with an **ADMIN** profile can access and configure these settings.

This guide walks you through the complete process of setting up SMTP for your Palmr installation, ensuring that email-dependent features work seamlessly.

## Why configure SMTP?

Configuring SMTP is essential for enabling key email functionalities that enhance the user experience and ensure proper system operation.

The main functionalities that depend on SMTP configuration are:

- **Password Reset** – Users who forget their password and cannot access the **Settings** panel need this feature to regain access to their accounts.
- **Email Notifications** – Recipients will receive email notifications when new shares are sent to them, keeping them informed about shared content.

Without proper SMTP configuration, these features will not work, potentially leaving users unable to recover their accounts or stay informed about shared files.

Now, let's go through the step-by-step process to configure the **SMTP Server**.

## Accessing SMTP settings

To configure SMTP settings, you'll need administrative access to the Palmr settings panel.

### Prerequisites

Before beginning the configuration process:

- Ensure you have **ADMIN** user privileges in Palmr
- Have your SMTP server credentials ready
- For Gmail users, prepare to generate an App Password

### Navigating to settings

To access **Settings**, an **ADMIN** user must click on the profile picture in the **header** and select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.

## Configuring SMTP server

The SMTP configuration process involves enabling the service and configuring the necessary connection details.

### Enabling SMTP

The first step is to **enable SMTP** by selecting "Yes" in the **SMTP Enabled** field.

### Configuration fields

Once SMTP is enabled, you can configure the other necessary fields:

**Sender Name** – This will appear as the sender's name in all outgoing emails. Use a recognizable name like "Palmr" or your organization name.

**Sender Email** – The email address from which notifications will be sent. Use a professional address like "noreply@palmr.app" or "notifications@yourdomain.com".

**SMTP Server** – The SMTP server address provided by your email service. For Gmail, use `smtp.gmail.com` (this is the recommended option and set as default).

**SMTP Port** – The server port used for connections. For Gmail, the standard port is **587** (TLS encryption).

**SMTP Username** – The username for authenticating with your SMTP server. For Gmail, enter your complete email address.

**SMTP Password** – The password for SMTP authentication. For Gmail, you must use an **App Password** (not your regular email password).

### Important security note

**Important:** If using **Gmail**, you need to generate an **App Password** instead of using your standard email password. This provides better security and is required for applications like Palmr.

For other email services, consult the official documentation of the service provider you are using. We recommend using Gmail for its simplicity, reliability, and reasonable email sending limits.

## Generating a Gmail App Password

Gmail requires App Passwords for third-party applications to ensure account security while maintaining functionality.

### Step-by-step process

To generate an App Password for Gmail:

1. **Access Your Account**: Go to [Google My Account](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. **Navigate to Security**: Select the **Security** section from the menu
3. **Find App Passwords**: Scroll down to locate **App Passwords** (you may need to enable 2-factor authentication first)
4. **Generate Password**: Create a new password specifically for Palmr
5. **Save Securely**: Copy and store the generated password safely

### Gmail configuration summary

When using Gmail, your final settings should be:

- **SMTP Server**: `smtp.gmail.com`
- **SMTP Port**: `587`
- **SMTP Username**: Your Gmail address
- **SMTP Password**: Generated App Password (16 characters)

## Testing your configuration

After completing the configuration, it's important to verify that everything works correctly.

### Validation steps

1. **Save Settings**: Apply your SMTP configuration in the Palmr interface
2. **Test Password Reset**: Try the password reset feature with a test account to ensure emails are sent
3. **Test Notifications**: Create a test share to verify that notification emails are delivered
4. **Check Email Delivery**: Confirm that emails arrive in the recipient's inbox (not spam folder)

### Troubleshooting common issues

If emails are not being sent:

- Verify that all fields are filled correctly
- For Gmail, ensure you're using the App Password, not your regular password
- Check that your email provider allows SMTP connections
- Confirm that port 587 is not blocked by your firewall

## Finalizing SMTP configuration

After entering the correct information and testing the functionality, save the settings.

Your Palmr installation is now ready to:

- Send password reset emails to users who need account recovery
- Deliver share notifications to recipients automatically
- Provide a complete user experience with reliable email communication

With SMTP properly configured, users can take full advantage of Palmr's email-dependent features, ensuring a smooth and professional experience when sharing files and managing their accounts.
