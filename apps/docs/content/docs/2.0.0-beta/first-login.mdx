After successfully initiating all required services according to the detailed deployment instructions provided, you will gain access to the frontend interface through the following designated endpoints:

- **Production environment:** `{your_web_domain}`  or `{your_server_ip}` - This is your primary access point for the live application deployment
- **Local environment:** [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173/) - This endpoint is specifically for development and testing purposes

Upon successfully navigating to the frontend interface through either of these endpoints, you will be presented with a comprehensive welcome screen, as illustrated in the image below:

What you are viewing is the **Palmr. landing page** ‚ú®, which serves as an introductory interface providing essential information about the application's capabilities and features. While this landing page is displayed by default during your initial setup, you have the flexibility to modify this configuration later. Should you prefer, you can configure the system to bypass this landing page and present the login interface as your primary entry point. However, for the purposes of initial system familiarization, the landing page is deliberately set as the default welcome screen.

## üîë First Login

Prominently displayed at the top of the landing page, you will notice a clearly marked button that enables you to authenticate and access Palmr.:

To facilitate a smooth onboarding experience, Palmr. has been thoughtfully designed with pre-configured **seed data** that is automatically implemented during the initial system initialization. This preliminary data setup includes a comprehensive **admin user** account that is granted complete access privileges, enabling full control over all system settings and user management functionalities within the application environment.

Upon selecting the **Login** button, the system will seamlessly redirect you to the authentication interface, which presents itself as shown in the following image:

![Login Page](/assets/v1/ui/login.png)

For your initial access to the system, please utilize these pre-configured authentication credentials:

### üë§ Admin Credentials

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |
| `admin@example.com` | `admin123` |

Following successful validation of your credentials, the system will authenticate your session and automatically direct you to Palmr.'s primary dashboard interface, which appears as demonstrated in this image:

Having completed these steps successfully, you have now established an authenticated session and are fully prepared to explore and utilize the comprehensive feature set that Palmr. has to offer! üéâ

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations After First Access

Please follow this detailed sequence of steps to update your administrative credentials and enhance the security of your Palmr. installation:

### üîß Access the Profile Settings

1. Locate and click the **user icon** positioned in the upper right corner of your screen interface.
2. Upon clicking, you will be presented with an expandable dropdown menu containing several configuration options:
