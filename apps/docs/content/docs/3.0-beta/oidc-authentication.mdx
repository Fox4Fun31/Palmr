Palmr supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, allowing users to sign in using external identity providers such as Google, Microsoft Azure AD, Keycloak, Auth0, and other OIDC-compliant services. This feature provides seamless single sign-on (SSO) capabilities and centralized user management.

OIDC authentication in Palmr is built using the industry-standard OpenID Connect protocol with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. The implementation supports automatic user provisioning, role mapping, and flexible configuration options.

## Why use OIDC authentication?

OIDC authentication provides several advantages for organizations and users:

**Centralized Authentication**: Users can authenticate using their existing organizational credentials without creating separate accounts for Palmr.

**Enhanced Security**: OIDC provides robust security features including token-based authentication, PKCE flow, and standardized protocols.

**Single Sign-On**: Users can access Palmr seamlessly if they're already authenticated with their identity provider.

**User Management**: Administrators can manage user access centrally through their existing identity provider.

**Compliance**: OIDC helps meet organizational security and compliance requirements by leveraging existing identity infrastructure.

## User experience

Once OIDC is properly configured, users will have a seamless authentication experience integrated into Palmr's login flow.

### Login process

1. **Access Palmr**: Users navigate to the Palmr login page
2. **Choose OIDC**: Users select the OIDC/SSO login option
3. **Provider Authentication**: Users are redirected to authenticate with their identity provider
4. **Automatic Return**: After successful authentication, users are automatically redirected back to Palmr
5. **Dashboard Access**: Users gain immediate access to their Palmr dashboard

### User account management

**Automatic Provisioning**: New users are automatically created when they first authenticate via OIDC (if auto-registration is enabled).

**Profile Synchronization**: User profile information (name, email) is synchronized from the identity provider during each login.

**Role Assignment**: User roles and permissions can be automatically assigned based on identity provider attributes or configured rules.

### Account unification

**Email-Based Matching**: If a user authenticates via OIDC using the same email address as an existing credential-based account, both authentication methods will be linked to the same user account.

**Dual Authentication Options**: Users who have both credential-based and OIDC authentication set up can choose either method to log in:

- Traditional email/password authentication
- OIDC/SSO authentication through their identity provider

**Seamless Experience**: Regardless of which authentication method is used, users will access the same account with all their files, shares, and settings preserved.

**Account Consolidation**: This feature ensures that users don't accidentally create duplicate accounts and can transition smoothly between authentication methods as organizational requirements change.
