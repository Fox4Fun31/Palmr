Having trouble with **permission denied** errors when using bind-mounted directories? This guide will help you configure <span className="font-bold">Palmr.</span> to work seamlessly with your host system's <span className="font-bold italic">user and group permissions</span>.

This is particularly common on **NAS systems** like Synology or QNAP, where the container's default UID/GID doesn't match your host system. Instead of manually changing directory ownership on your host, Palmr. now supports <span className="font-bold italic">flexible UID/GID configuration</span> to automatically handle these permission conflicts.

## The Problem

By default, Palmr. runs with UID 1001 and GID 1001 inside the container. When you bind-mount a directory from your host system (like `./data:/app/server`), permission conflicts can occur if:

- Your host user has a different UID/GID
- You're running on a NAS system with specific user configurations
- The mounted directory ownership doesn't match the container user

This results in errors like:

- **Access denied** even with 777 permissions
- **Database connection failures** (SQLite can't create/access files)
- **File upload failures** in the application

## The Solution

Palmr. now supports **runtime UID/GID configuration** through environment variables. The container will automatically adjust its internal user permissions to match your host system, eliminating the need to manually change directory ownership.

## Environment Variables

Configure these **optional** environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable    | Description                        | Default | When to Use                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `PALMR_UID` | User ID for the container process  | 1001    | When host directory owner has different UID |
| `PALMR_GID` | Group ID for the container process | 1001    | When host directory group has different GID |

> **Important**: These variables are **completely optional**. If you don't set them, Palmr. works exactly as before with UID/GID 1001.

## Finding Your Host UID/GID

Before configuring, you need to find your host system's user and group IDs:

```bash
# Find your user ID
id -u

# Find your group ID
id -g

# See both together
id
```

Example output:

```bash
$ id
uid=1000(myuser) gid=1000(mygroup) groups=1000(mygroup),27(sudo)
```

In this example, you would use `PALMR_UID=1000` and `PALMR_GID=1000`.

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Linux System

Most Linux desktop systems use UID/GID 1000 for the first user:

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: docker.io/kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - ENABLE_S3=false
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-this-key-in-production-min-32-chars
      # Add these lines to match your host user
      - PALMR_UID=1000
      - PALMR_GID=1000
    ports:
      - "5487:5487"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/server
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Synology NAS

Synology systems commonly use these UID/GID combinations:

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: docker.io/kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - ENABLE_S3=false
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-this-key-in-production-min-32-chars
      # Common Synology configuration
      - PALMR_UID=1026
      - PALMR_GID=100
    ports:
      - "5487:5487"
    volumes:
      - /volume1/docker/palmr/data:/app/server
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### QNAP NAS

QNAP systems typically use:

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: docker.io/kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - ENABLE_S3=false
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-this-key-in-production-min-32-chars
      # Common QNAP configuration
      - PALMR_UID=1000
      - PALMR_GID=100
    ports:
      - "5487:5487"
    volumes:
      - /share/Container/palmr/data:/app/server
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### No Configuration Needed

If you're not experiencing permission issues, you don't need to set these variables:

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: docker.io/kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - ENABLE_S3=false
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-this-key-in-production-min-32-chars
      # No PALMR_UID/PALMR_GID needed - uses defaults
    ports:
      - "5487:5487"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/server
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Migration for Existing Installations

If you already have Palmr. running and want to add UID/GID configuration:

### Step 1: Backup Your Data

```bash
docker-compose down
cp -r ./data ./data-backup
```

### Step 2: Update docker-compose.yml

Add the UID/GID environment variables to your existing configuration:

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: docker.io/kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - ENABLE_S3=false
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-existing-key
      # Add these new lines
      - PALMR_UID=1000 # Your host user UID
      - PALMR_GID=1000 # Your host group GID
    # ... rest of your configuration
```

### Step 3: Restart Palmr.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The container will automatically detect the new UID/GID configuration and adjust permissions accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

### Checking Current Configuration

To verify your container is running with the correct UID/GID:

```bash
# Check the user ID inside the container
docker exec palmr id

# Check file ownership in the mounted volume
docker exec palmr ls -la /app/server/
```

### Permission Issues Persist

If you're still having permission issues after configuration:

```bash
# Check container logs for UID/GID adjustment messages
docker-compose logs palmr | grep -i "uid\|gid"

# Manually fix permissions if needed
docker exec -u root palmr chown -R palmr:nodejs /app/server
```

### Finding NAS-Specific UID/GID

For NAS systems, check your system's user management interface or use SSH:

```bash
# On your NAS, check existing users
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v nobody

# Check groups
cat /etc/group
```

## How It Works

When you set `PALMR_UID` and/or `PALMR_GID` environment variables:

1. **Container startup**: The container detects the environment variables
2. **User adjustment**: Automatically modifies the internal `palmr` user to use your specified UID/GID
3. **Ownership update**: Updates file ownership of application directories
4. **Conflict handling**: Gracefully handles cases where the UID/GID already exists
5. **Logging**: Provides clear feedback about what changes were made

The process is completely automatic and requires no manual intervention.

## Build-Time Customization

For advanced users who want to build custom images with different default UID/GID:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg PALMR_UID=2000 \
  --build-arg PALMR_GID=2000 \
  -t palmr:custom .
```

This sets new defaults at build time, which can still be overridden with environment variables at runtime.

## Summary

The UID/GID configuration feature makes Palmr. **universally compatible** with different host systems without requiring manual permission changes. Key benefits:

- ✅ **Automatic permission handling** - No manual `chown` commands needed
- ✅ **NAS system compatibility** - Tested with Synology and QNAP
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - Existing installations continue to work unchanged
- ✅ **Optional configuration** - Only use when needed
- ✅ **Runtime flexibility** - Change UID/GID without rebuilding images

If you're experiencing permission issues with bind-mounted directories, try adding the appropriate `PALMR_UID` and `PALMR_GID` environment variables to your configuration. The container will handle the rest automatically!
